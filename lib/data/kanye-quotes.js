  text: 'I refuse to accept other people\'s ideas of happiness for me. As if there\'s a \'one size fits all\' standard for happiness. We came into a broken world. And we\'re the cleanup crew. We all self-conscious. I\'m just the first to admit it. George Bush doesn\'t care about black people. I would hear stories about Steve Jobs and feel like he was at 100 percent exactly what he wanted to do, but I\'m sure even a Steve Jobs has compromised. Even a Rick Owens has compromised. You know, even a Kanye West has compromised. Sometimes you don\'t even know when you\'re being compromised till after the fact, and that\'s what you regret. I am Warhol. I am the No. 1 most impactful artist of our generation. I am Shakespeare in the flesh. I have decided in 2020 to run for president. Here\'s something that\'s contrary to popular belief: I actually don\'t like thinking. I think people think I like to think a lot. And I don\'t. I do not like to think at all. Blacks, especially in America, have been raised with a slave mentality - they don\'t feel that they have the right to speak as loud as possible. Know your worth! People always act like they\'re doing more for you than you\'re doing for them. For me, money is not my definition of success. Inspiring people is a definition of success. Nothing in life is promised except death. If you have the opportunity to play this game of life you need to appreciate every moment. a lot of people don\'t appreciate the moment until it\'s passed. I ain\'t here to argue about his facial features. Or here to convert atheists into believers. I\'m just trying to say the way school need teachers the way Kathie Lee needed Regis that\'s the way yall need Jesus. I know I got angels watchin me from the other side. They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus, that means guns, sex, lies, video tapes, but if I talk about God my record won\'t get played Huh? I don\'t know what\'s better gettin\' laid or gettin\' paid. This dark diction has become America\'s addiction. If you see a black family, it\'s looting, but if it\'s a white family they are looking for food. I\'ll say things that are serious and put them in a joke form so people can enjoy them. We laugh to keep from crying. People always say that you can\'t please everybody. I think that\'s a cop-out. Why not attempt it? \'Cause think of all the people you will please if you try. It was a strike against me that I didn\'t wear baggy jeans and jerseys and that I never hustled, never sold drugs. But for me to have the opportunity to stand in front of a bunch of executives and present myself, I had to hustle in my own way. I can\'t tell you how frustrating it was that they didn\'t get that. No joke - I\'d leave meetings crying all the time. I didn\'t want to play it boring and safe. I also didn\'t want to innovate too much. Second albums, man, they\'re even scarier than first ones. I\'m pretty calculating. I take stuff that I know appeals to people\'s bad sides and match it up with stuff that appeals to their good sides. Black people can be the most conservative, the most discriminating. Especially among ourselves. It wasn\'t white people who said all black men have to wear baggy jeans. Michael Jordan changed so much in basketball, he took his power to make a difference. It\'s so much going on in music right now and somebody has to make a difference. The concept of commercialism in the fashion and art world is looked down upon. You know, just to think, \'What amount of creativity does it take to make something that masses of people like?\' And, \'How does creativity apply across the board?\' Why, if someone is good in one field can they not be accepted or given the slightest opportunity to express and be creative in other fields? Fashion breaks my heart. Thirty-three-years-old, still creating art. It\'s rage, it\'s creativity, it\'s pain, it\'s hurt, but it\'s the opportunity to still have my voice get out there through music. I thank Marc Jacobs so much for giving me the opportunity to design a shoe for Louis Vuitton, but the thing that broke my heart most was when they said, \'You\'re finished. The shoe\'s finished.\' Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to god, and keep your face to the raising sun. Our work is never over. I was never really good at anything except for the ability to learn. I can always tell if a band has a British rhythm section due to the gritty production. I hate the way they portray us in the media. If you see a black family it says they\'re looting, if you see a white family it says they\'re looking for food. I still think I am the greatest. Would you believe in what you believe in if you were the only one who believed it? I am not a fan of books. I would never want a book\'s autograph. I am a proud non-reader of books. I don\'t even listen to rap. My apartment is too nice to listen to rap in. Sometimes people write novels and they just be so wordy and so self-absorbed. I am God\'s vessel. But my greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live. I feel like I\'m too busy writing history to read it. If I was just a fan of music, I would think that I was the number one artist in the world. I will go down as the voice of this generation, of this decade, I will be the loudest voice. I really appreciate the moments that I was able to win rap album of the year or whatever. My message isn\'t perfectly defined. I have, as a human being, fallen to peer pressure. Creative output, you know, is just pain. I\'m going to be cliche for a minute and say that great art comes from pain. I liberate minds with my music. That\'s more important than liberating a few people from apartheid or whatever. You don\'t have to be scared of me, because I am loyal. Why are people so scared of creative ideas and so scared of truth? All I want to do is do good. I think I do myself a disservice by comparing myself to Steve Jobs and Walt Disney and human beings that we\'ve seen before. It should be more like Willy Wonka... and welcome to my chocolate factory. In Paris, you\'re as far as possible from the land of pleasant smiles. Man, I\'m the No. 1 living and breathing rock star. I am Axl Rose; I am Jim Morrison; I am Jimi Hendrix. Nobody can tell me where I can and can\'t go. I told y\'all I didn\'t vote, right? But if I would\'ve voted, I would\'ve voted for Trump. People always tell you, \'Be humble. Be humble.\' When was the last time someone told you to be amazing? Be great! Be great! Be awesome! Be awesome! I\'m giving all that I have in this life. I\'m opening up my notebook, and I\'m saying everything in there out loud. The risk for me would be in not taking one - that\'s the only thing that\'s really risky for me. I\'m a trained fine artist. I went to art school from the time I was 5 years old. I was, like, a prodigy out of Chicago. I\'d been in national competitions from the age of 14. Madonna, I think, is the greatest visual musical artist that we\'ve ever had. If you look at her photo log, the photographers that she was able to work with throughout her career framed her in the proper way. It was the proper context. It was that visual that made sure that everything was gonna cut through in a certain way. Sometimes we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win. I\'m not always going to say things the perfect way, the right way. But I\'m going to say how I feel. There\'s a lack of people in power that are motivated by the idea of helping people. In today\'s world, having money has allowed people who are extremely uncool to think that they\'re cool and carry it like that. People who really are cool and people who really are artists and have ideas have to literally turn in their cool card to society just to make it past the age of 28. I wouldn\'t say that anyone in fashion is on my side. I don\'t think there\'s anyone on my side. I\'m inspired by Walt Disney. I\'m inspired by Howard Hughes. I\'m inspired by Henry Ford. I\'m inspired by Steve Jobs. I mean, I\'m inspired by James Perse. My goal is just to be respected as a man when I walk down the street with my family. I don\'t care what your job is, you\'re not gonna talk down to me, you\'re not gonna try to get a rise out of me. I\'m a man first. And in establishing that, some interesting things have happened. People have me pinned as a shark or a predator in some way, and in no way am I that. I wouldn\'t want to hurt anyone. I want to defend people. I want to help people. I\'m here to fight for the re-education of what celebrity is: to say, \'Yes, we are celebrities, but yes, we\'re also innovators. We\'re also inventors. We\'re also thoughtful.\' The concept of Kimye has more cultural significance than what Page Six could write. My favorite record label of all time is Motown. That era of music was my favorite. All these walls that keep us from loving each other as one family or one race - racism, religion, where we grew up, whatever, class, socioeconomic - what makes us be so selfish and prideful, what keeps us from wanting to help the next man, what makes us be so focused on a personal legacy as opposed to the entire legacy of a race. The dinosaurs aren\'t remembered for much more than their bones. When humanity\'s gone, what do we give to this little planet that we\'re on, and what could we do collectively, removing the pride? Every time I say something that\'s extremely truthful out loud, it literally breaks the Internet. Our focus needs to be less on what our legacy\'s going to be or how we can control each other and more how we can give to each other. I can analyze people\'s intentions. Immediately. That\'s just a warning. To everyone. I used to have insecurity about my finances, then I announced that I had debt, and now I don\'t have any insecurities. I love sleep; it\'s my favorite. I don\'t use blue. I don\'t like it. It bugs me out. I hate it. If we go on your iPhone and go to the dictionary and look up \'humble,\' 80 per cent of the definition is negative. It\'s a controlling word. It\'s a way to control the masses and to control the sheep. It\'s always going to be a fight for anyone who isn\'t an older white man. I want to fight for anyone who doesn\'t have a fight. I just want people to be the best thems and live the happiest lives possible. There was a time Michael Jackson couldn\'t get his video on MTV because he was considered to be \'urban.\' The Michael Jackson. So I literally have to be the Michael Jackson of apparel in order to break down the doors for everyone who will come after I\'m gone, after I\'m dead. We\'re a blip in the existence of the universe, and we\'re constantly trying to pull each other down. Not doing things to help each other. I know how to swim through backlash. I can tread water through backlash... If anything, that\'s all giving me power. The most genius thing about the way I create is to create with other geniuses. You know what should be banned? Stuff that\'s whack. The world is controversial. The world is classist. The world is racist. I love being American, and I love family. I love having a family, and I feel so blessed, and I feel like God gave me exactly what I wanted, so now I have to do the right thing in God\'s eyes also. Just follow what God wants me to do. I didn\'t know the term \'synesthesia\' until I was working on \'Cruel Summer.\' Halfway into writing that, I really understood that, my entire life, I had been trying to describe this condition of mine: through painting, through this seven-screen Surround Vision film we shot in Qatar, through all these things. I\'m really bad with answering questions. Usually, I don\'t even answer them. I try to find inspiration inside of the question. I think, and I jump from one beam of inspiration or energy to the next, as opposed to explaining the energy. I\'m a human being. I\'ve got opinions, I\'m not always right, I\'m not always on time, I don\'t always say things in the proper way, but my intentions are always extremely pure. I dislike the concept of \'chic\' being the highest compliment for a human being. I\'d rather someone be nice than to be chic. Fashion is merely an opinion. And I\'ve got a lot of opinions. Art is to be free. Design is to fix. My doorman is more important to me than any head of any company. He keeps us safe. I definitely think, generally, rap is misogynistic. Do I worry about being in the public eye and raising kids? Yeah. Any situation you\'re in, you\'re gonna worry about raising kids. But it\'s champagne problems, too. There are people who can\'t feed their kids. I don\'t think people are going to talk in the future. They\'re going to communicate through eye contact, body language, emojis, signs. It\'s funny because I\'ve made a living off of words, but words get in the way of what you really want to say. I think business has to be stupider. I want to do really straightforward, stupid business - just talk to me like a 4-year-old. And I refuse to negotiate. I do not negotiate. I can collaborate. But I\'m an artist, so as soon as you negotiate, you\'re being compromised. It\'s not \'can\'; it\'s \'will.\' You have to will things into fruition. 2024 All you have to be is yourself Believe in your flyness...conquer your shyness. Burn that excel spread sheet Decentralize Distraction is the enemy of vision Everything you do in life stems from either fear or love For me giving up is way harder than trying. For me, money is not my definition of success. Inspiring people is a definition of success Fur pillows are hard to actually sleep on George Bush doesn\'t care about black people Have you ever thought you were in love with someone but then realized you were just staring in a mirror for 20 minutes? I care. I care about everything. Sometimes not giving a f#%k is caring the most. I feel calm but energized I feel like I\'m too busy writing history to read it. I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex I give up drinking every week I leave my emojis bart Simpson color I love sleep; it\'s my favorite. I make awesome decisions in bike stores!!! I really love my Tesla. I\'m in the future. Thank you Elon. I still think I am the greatest. I think I do myself a disservice by comparing myself to Steve Jobs and Walt Disney and human beings that we\'ve seen before. It should be more like Willy Wonka...and welcome to my chocolate factory. I want the world to be better! All I want is positive! All I want is dopeness! I wish I had a friend like me I\'d like to meet with Tim Cook. I got some ideas I\'ll say things that are serious and put them in a joke form so people can enjoy them. We laugh to keep from crying. I\'m a creative genius I\'m nice at ping pong I\'m the best If I don\'t scream, if I don\'t say something then no one\'s going to say anything. If I got any cooler I would freeze to death Just stop lying about shit. Just stop lying. Keep squares out yo circle Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to god, and keep your face to the rising sun. Let\'s be like water Man... whatever happened to my antique fish tank? My dad got me a drone for Christmas My greatest award is what I\'m about to do. My greatest pain in life is that I will never be able to see myself perform live. One day I\'m gon\' marry a porn star One of my favorite of many things about what the Trump hat represents to me is that people can\'t tell me what to do because I\'m black Only free thinkers People always say that you can\'t please everybody. I think that\'s a cop-out. Why not attempt it? Cause think of all the people that you will please if you try. People always tell you \'Be humble. Be humble.\' When was the last time someone told you to be amazing? Be great! Be awesome! Be awesome! People only get jealous when they care. Perhaps I should have been more like water today Pulling up in the may bike Shut the fuck up I will fucking laser you with alien fucking eyes and explode your fucking head Sometimes I push the door close button on people running towards the elevator. I just need my own elevator sometimes. My sanctuary. Sometimes you have to get rid of everything Style is genderless The thought police want to suppress freedom of thought The world is our family The world is our office Today is the best day ever and tomorrow\'s going to be even better Truth is my goal. Controversy is my gym. I\'ll do a hundred reps of controversy for a 6 pack of truth Tweeting is legal and also therapeutic We all self-conscious. I\'m just the first to admit it. We came into a broken world. And we\'re the cleanup crew. You can\'t look at a glass half full or empty if it\'s overflowing. I hate when I\'m on a flight and I wake up with a water bottle next to me like oh great now I gotta be responsible for this water bottle'
